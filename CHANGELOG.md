# Changelog

All notable changes to VulnFuse are documented here. The project follows semantic versioning after the initial alpha boundary.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-09

### Security

- Replaced trailing identifier punctuation cleanup with a linear scan to avoid pathological regular-expression work on attacker-controlled reports.
- Render Markdown component values with delimiter-aware code spans so embedded backticks and backslashes cannot break the report structure.
- Excluded the generated Action bundle from duplicate CodeQL analysis while retaining source analysis, dependency audit, and bundle-drift verification.

### Changed

- Added a verified direct-from-release CLI installation path.
- Deferred TypeScript major updates until the `typescript-eslint` peer range supports them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Canonical finding and correlation-result schemas.
- Parsers for SARIF 2.1, Trivy, Grype, Snyk, CycloneDX JSON, OSV-Scanner JSON, CSV, and VulnFuse JSON.
- Deterministic scoring, blockers, instance/root-cause scope, candidate indexing, stable IDs, and rejected-candidate evidence.
- JSON, SARIF, CSV, and Markdown exporters.
- Node.js CLI with stdin, bounded reads, atomic output, inspection, and severity exit codes.
- Node 24 GitHub Action with bounded glob input, job summary, and outputs.
- Local-only browser workbench with safe synthetic demo and multi-format downloads.
- CI, CodeQL, Pages deployment, dependency updates, security policy, threat model, and contribution guidance.
